To filter your input file, check "Yes" box below the question "Do you want to use filters" and write appropriate expression in the field "Type prefered filter".
You should write any expression that will return True or False for every object described in your file.
These are the variables you can use:
- sequences - string representing sequence
- seqIDs - string representing sequence's ID
- references - string representing reference chromosomes
- refURIs - ?
- refLens - dictionary containing lengths of reference chromosomes (as strings)
- sources - ?
- methods - ?
- starts - integer, start of the sequence
- stops - integer, end of the sequence
- scores - ?
- strands - strand of the sequence, single char ('+' / '-' / '.')
- phases - ?
- groups - ?
- group_gff - ?
- descriptions - string with description of the sequence
- MAPQ - string
- CIGAR - string?...
- quality - string, quality of mapping

For example, expression 'descriptions == "a thaliana"' will leave only sequences which description is "a thaliana".
You can also use python functions, so for examle expression
	len(sequences) >= 30 and len(sequences) <= 100
will filter out all the sequences shorter than 30 and longer than 100, and
	"AACTG" in sequences or descriptions.startswith("Mus musculus")
will leave only sequences containing "AACTG" or those which descriptions starts with "Mus musculus".

Bear in mind that not all of attributes described above are present in every format.
